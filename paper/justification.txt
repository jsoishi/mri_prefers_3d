Understanding the generation of magnetic fields via dynamo action is among the most important problems in geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics. On general theoretical grounds, dynamo action requires three-dimensional motions. The magnetorotational instability is one of the most important instabilities in astrophysics, and it has long been assumed to be two dimensional in its linear phase. Our work conclusively shows that the MRI contains an important portion of parameter space with three dimensional behavior. One important implications of this is that the MRI may lead to direct dynamo action without driving MHD turbulence in stars and liquid metal experiments.
